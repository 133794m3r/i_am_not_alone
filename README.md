# I Am Not Alone

This project is a website that features a prototype of an interactive chatbot open to the public. The goal of the chatbot is to aid users to explore their feelings and for suicide prevention. When faced with specific keywords related to negative psychological emotions (such as ones that show signs of sucicide or COVID-19 depression), the chatbot would respond immediately and provide local crisis hotline for the users of the chatbot. 


This project has being created for the purposes of the Same Home Different Hacks hackathon during 6-12-2020 through 6-14-2020.
